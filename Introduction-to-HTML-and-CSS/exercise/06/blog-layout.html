            <p>Snowboarding is a recreational and competitive activity that involves descending a snow-covered surface
                while standing on a snowboard that is almost always attached to a rider's feet. It features in the
                Winter Olympic Games and Winter Paralympic Games.

                Snowboarding was developed in the United States, inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing, and
                skiing. It became popular around the world and was introduced as a Winter Olympic Sport at Nagano in
                1998[1] and featured in the Winter Paralympics at Sochi in 2014.[2] As of 2015, its popularity (as
                measured by equipment sales) in the United States peaked in 2007 and has been in a decline since.[3][4]

            <p id="about">DeepJak aka Dimitar Kostov is a young and talented Russian who was born in 1986 and raised in Sofia,
                Bulgaria. He was only 16 years old when he found his passion for electronic music and started mixing
                techno tracks of the well-known DJs like Umek, Sven Vath, Marco Carola, Pedro Delgardo, Adam Beyer,
                Cari Lekebusch and many many more. He started playing at private parties, organized by him, which gave
                him the opportunity to improve his DJ skills. It was then when he decided to further experiment with
                styles like elektro, tribal, house and minimal-techno transforming his sets into melodic and danceable
                music turned out to be very successful and he quickly started gaining popularity among clubbers in
                Bulgaria. For few years the excellent DJs skills combined with the unique choice of tracks helped
                Deepjak to build reputation of an artist capable of breathing new life into the Bulgarian electronic
                scene. At that time he met Valex and the Puppet and the idea for an event-planning organization called
                “MINIMALISM” was born. At the beginning “MINIMALISM” supported the idea of underground and
                non-commercial events but following the great success of their parties, the boys started receiving
                invitation to play alongside one of the most prominent world DJs at major events in clubs like Escape,
                Viper Rooms , Black Box , Party Center 4 km , Life House, Cacao, Dance Club Mania, Masai, Comics and
                many more. For the last two years, Deepjak popularized his sound outside Bulgaria as he was invited to
                perform in clubs like Bamboo (Switzerland) and the Code 21(Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Currently,
                Deepjak is a manager of “MINIMALISM” organizing events featuring international and well-know DJs in
                different clubs in Bulgaria. His parties are of great success and there are a lot more to come…</p>
