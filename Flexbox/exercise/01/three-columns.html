            <h1>Three laws of robotics</h1>
            <p>Rules developed by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who sought to create an ethical system
                for humans and
                robots.
            </p>

            <div>
                <h2>1st Law</h2>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come
                to
                harm
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>2nd Law</h2>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would
                conflict with the First Law
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>3rd Law</h2>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with
                the
                First or Second Law
            </div>

            <p>Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or zeroth law, that superseded the
                others. It
                stated
                that “a robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”
